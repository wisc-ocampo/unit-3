## overview
A map showing the population density across Japan's prefectures over the last 70 years. 
Users are able to change the currently viewed year to have the graph re-express itself to the current year.

**Main** branch is mostly stable.
**Experimental** is currently not functional as topojson conversion creates an issue with the bathymetry layers.

Data from Natural Earth, Wikipedia.
