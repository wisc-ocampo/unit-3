## overview
A map showing the population density across Japan's prefectures over the last 70 years. 
Users are able to change the currently viewed year to have the graph re-express itself to the current year.
*Note: this graph is logarithmic!*

Data from Natural Earth & Wikipedia.
*Note: to make the data work, Okinawa has some of its values (1950 - 1970) as simple estimations. (Data did not exist due to being under control of the United States at the time.)*
